    "REASON FOR CHOOSING MISTRAL 7B\n",
    "\n",
    "For fine-tuning on a domain-specific question-answer dataset, Mistral 7B is generally considered better than BERT for several reasons. Mistral 7B is a modern language model with 7 billion parameters that outperforms larger models like Llama 2 13B on many benchmarks, including question answering. It uses advanced attention mechanisms like Grouped-Query Attention for faster inference and Sliding Window Attention for handling long inputs efficiently. Mistral 7B supports much longer context lengths than BERT, which is important for complex QA tasks. It also performs well on domain-specific applications such as medical question answering, showing superior precision compared to other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, while BERT has been a pioneering model for QA and is efficient for smaller tasks, it is older and limited by its smaller context window and architecture focused more on masked language modeling rather than autoregressive generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if you want one recommendation for a smaller model to fine-tune on domain-specific QA datasets, Mistral 7B is the better choice due to its improved performance, efficiency, and robustness on longer sequences and instruction-following tasks."
